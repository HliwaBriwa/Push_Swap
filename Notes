        Warnings :

        - I didnt create the the same function  for a and also b u can call the same function but with the other variable of b ! 
        - what if the integer Overflows ! 
        - what if the array of characters contains a alphabet ! 
        - dont forget the leaks when moving the structs from stack to stack ! 
        - Does the av take more than an integer number causing malloc overflow !
        - what if the array is empty ! 
        - when failing free the array of pointers !
        - Check for the arrya of integer is empty in the first move or it will cause problems !
        - The reason why i added the before variable is in the rra we can set the one before the last to the null without a variable 





        Cases :

        - When the array contains the Alphabet the "ft_sidek" function return NULL then the pushswap returns NULL and the program

        should return NULL !




        Planing : 

        - Its better to create the funcitons (sa sb .........) will make it  easier to  track the moves ! 

        - Look in the libft for functions to help set the  content to the variable of the struct : NUM! 





        Steps : 

        1- create the array of integer   in  the heap !         DONE !

        2- create an array of integer pointers          DONE !

        3- Convert the the character numbers to an integers  and put them  in the heap then put there addresses
            in the array of pointers !

        4- create a struct that contains integer pointer and the struct pointer for the next struct !  DONE !

        5- Put each address of the integer in the integer pointer in the struct !

        6- Link the struct with each others, Possibly u'll need to go in the other sense so u 'll need a variable
            holding the struct before too ! 

        5- create the methods functions Try not to forget the leaks ! 






        Methods Exp :

        ra : we made the last struct points to the first and modified the double pointer to point to the second struct !
