        Warnings :

        - what if the integer Overflows ! 
        - what if the array of characters contains a alphabet !
        - dont forget the leaks when moving the structs from stack to stack ! 



        Planing : 

        - Its better to create the funcitons (sa sb .........) will make it  easier to  track the moves ! 

        - Look in the libft for functions to help set the  content to the variable of the struct : NUM! 

        - Due to the functions Structure in the libft Project u have to create the array of integers seperatedly 




        Steps : 

        1- create the array of integers in  the heap !         DONE !

        2- convert the characters from the array av to Integers and line them in array of the integers in the heap !            DONE !

        3- create a struct that contains integer pointer and the struct pointer for the struct before it !  DONE !

        4- Modify the " ft_lstnew " make the pointer for the before not the next ! DONE !




        STATUS :        Now we have the integers in the structs with the order they been inputed with ! 



        5- create the methods functions Try not to forge the leaks !
